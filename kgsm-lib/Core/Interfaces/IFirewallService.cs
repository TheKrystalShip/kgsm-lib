/// Typed client for the kgsm-firewall authority — the single C# entry point for driving the host-firewall
/// door over its control socket. Surfaces above (the Discord bot, the Control Panel API) open/close/list

/// <para>
/// Transport is one newline-delimited JSON request → one reply over a unix-domain socket (the authority
/// carries no HTTP stack); the wire contract is the <c>TheKrystalShip.KGSM.Firewall.Contracts</c> package,
/// and this client maps <see cref="PortMapping"/>↔the wire <c>PortDto</c> at its boundary (kgsm-firewall
/// owns its own port type and never references kgsm-lib's). The socket's filesystem permissions are the
/// security boundary; there is no in-band authentication.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Unreachable vs. unsuccessful.</b> When the authority cannot be reached (no socket, timeout, no/garbled
/// reply) every method throws <see cref="Exceptions.FirewallException"/> — the C# analog of the authority's
/// "unreachable" exit code, the abort-the-install signal. A reachable-but-unsuccessful operation instead
/// returns a typed result whose <c>Outcome</c>/<c>Status</c> distinguishes unsupported, op-failed, and
/// honest-unknown — never collapsed to a bare bool.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This client performs the firewall operation only; it emits no kgsm audit events. The
/// <c>instance_ports_opened</c>/<c>instance_ports_closed</c> events are emitted separately by the caller
/// via <see cref="IEventManagementService.EmitWithProvenance"/> (mirroring how the watchdog emits its own
/// events) — kept out of the transport client deliberately, so a missing event service can never silently
/// drop the audit trail.
