/// The write-side authority for blueprint files: creates, overwrites, and removes
/// <c>&lt;name&gt;.bp.yaml</c> files in kgsm's writable USER blueprints directory, and reads them from
/// either directory (<see cref="ReadRaw"/>). Two write paths sit side by side —
/// <see cref="Create"/> templates a typed native draft, <see cref="WriteRaw"/> commits exact bytes for
/// any runtime — and only the latter can round-trip a container blueprint or one carrying comments. The SECOND kgsm-lib
/// service that does direct <c>System.IO</c> (the first is <see cref="IInstanceFiles"/>, whose shape this
/// mirrors: atomic write, a jail, and an outcome-not-exception failure channel). The complementary
/// write-side to the existing read-only <see cref="IBlueprintService"/>.

/// <remarks>
/// Three non-negotiable guardrails:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><b>No semantic validation here.</b> This authority only performs STRUCTURAL checks (a required
///   field present, a safe name) — never re-implements what kgsm considers a *valid* blueprint (a legal
///   <c>runtime</c>, port-format parsing, ...). Every write must be validated by reading it back through
///   the engine's existing read path (<see cref="IBlueprintService.GetInfo(string)"/>) — the engine stays
///   the schema authority.</item>
/// <item><b>The jail root is learned from the engine, never re-derived in C#.</b> The user blueprints
///   directory is resolved fresh on every call from <c>kgsm --paths --json</c>'s
///   <c>user.KGSM_USER_BLUEPRINTS_DIR</c> (deserialized to <see cref="KgsmPaths"/> — a stable,
///   machine-readable contract, no free-form text parsing). This mirrors how <see cref="IInstanceFiles"/>
///   learns its jail root from <see cref="IInstanceService.GetInstanceInfo(string)"/>'s <c>WorkingDir</c>
///   rather than re-deriving XDG paths in C#.</item>
/// <item><b>AOT-safe YAML.</b> No YamlDotNet or other reflection-based serializer — the native schema is

///   field order matching <c>kgsm/templates/blueprint.tp</c>).</item>

/// whose <see cref="FileOpResult.Outcome"/> reports what happened — including an invalid name, a
/// resolution failure for the user blueprints dir, or a filesystem error — and none of these methods
