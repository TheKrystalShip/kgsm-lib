// Result types for the kgsm-firewall control client (IFirewallService). Unlike the watchdog DTOs these
// are NOT deserialized from the wire — FirewallService maps them in code from the
// TheKrystalShip.KGSM.Firewall.Contracts wire DTOs at its boundary — so they carry no [JsonPropertyName]
// and need no KgsmJsonContext registration. They deliberately preserve the authority's precise outcome
// (the C# analog of kgsm-firewall's exit-code contract: applied/removed/noop vs unsupported/op-failed vs
// honest-unknown), never collapsing it to a bare success bool — kgsm-api's future honest "is this port
// open" verdict depends on telling "the backend cannot answer" apart from "nothing is open".
