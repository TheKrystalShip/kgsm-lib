/// <c>kgsm-watchdog</c> — the same name the writer used to choose that path. The directory is therefore
/// ground truth rather than a second answer able to disagree with the writer, which is exactly what a
/// name-based convention could not be: a leaf's unit name and state directory are allowed to differ,
/// and on this host one pair does.

/// The engine falls out of the same rule — <c>/var/lib/kgsm/events</c>, producer <c>kgsm</c> — and is
/// added explicitly as well, because its journal directory is configurable and need not sit under the
/// state root at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A producer that has never written an event has no directory and is simply absent. That is the honest
/// answer: there is nothing to read, and listing it as an unreadable journal would report a leaf's
/// silence as a failure to read it.

/// ⚠ The scan finds a journal only where the writer's own default puts it. A producer configured to
/// write somewhere else is invisible to it — so a consumer that knows of such a journal names it

/// that keeps its OWN journal at a configured path makes it readable. A named journal is taken on the
