/// <para>
/// The live counterpart to <see cref="FederatedEventJournalHistory"/>. It composes one
/// <see cref="EventJournalReader"/> per producer rather than reimplementing the tail: whole-line
/// framing, segment rolling, straggler grace and gap detection are already solved once, and a second
/// implementation of them would be a second set of bugs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Each journal advances independently.</b> Every reader holds its own cursor, scoped to its
/// producer, so a leaf that was down catches up from where <em>its</em> journal left off without
/// replaying or skipping any other's. There is deliberately no attempt to order events across
/// journals as they arrive: a live stream delivers each line as it lands, and the total order is a
/// property of a <em>read</em> over the record, which is what the history reader is for.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Every event carries its producer.</b> The position handed to a consumer names the journal the
/// line came from, stamped here from the reader that produced it — never taken from the line — so a
/// consumer can key an event by <see cref="AuditId.ForPosition(string, string, long)"/> and never
/// collide two producers that happen to share a byte offset.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A journal whose directory does not exist yet is not an error: the underlying reader tolerates an
/// absent directory and picks up the first segment when it appears, so a leaf installed later starts
/// being tailed without a restart.
