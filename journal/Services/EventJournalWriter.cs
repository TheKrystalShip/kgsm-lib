/// no locking: concurrent appends interleave whole lines and never partial ones. A line longer than
/// <see cref="AtomicWriteLimitBytes"/> loses that guarantee and is logged, because a reader's cursor

/// order as documented, omits nulls instead of writing them (absent and null mean the same thing to
