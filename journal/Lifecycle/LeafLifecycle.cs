/// without producing a line per poll — which is what lets a caller say what it observes instead of
/// tracking what it has said.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The leaf writes no field names.</b> The payload is composed here, so these four events have
/// exactly one writer across the whole ecosystem however many leaves emit them. That is the point:
/// seven producers each spelling a payload by hand is the drift this layer exists to prevent, and it
/// is not hypothetical — it is already what a producer's threshold payload and the reader's class for
/// it are doing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Identity comes from <see cref="JournalRecorder"/> and is not overridden.</b> A leaf reporting on
/// itself was driven by no product surface, so the inherited <c>system:&lt;leaf&gt;</c> actor and
/// <c>system</c> origin are the true answers rather than defaults to accept. ⚠ This is a separate
/// recorder from the leaf's own for that reason: a leaf whose ordinary events are person-driven
/// overrides both to null, and reusing that recorder would stamp a lifecycle event with no author.
/// </para>
